This is the homepage of Saeed Jan. I am currently an ECE graduate student at the University of Toronto. You can email me at: contact \[at\] saeedc \[dot\] com.

My current research interest is building data-driven/differentiable solvers for electrodynamical problems. To that end, I like writing robust, reproducible software. Take a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/saeedece) for some examples of my work.
