This is the homepage of Saeed Jan. I am currently an ECE graduate student at the University of Toronto. You can reach me via email at [contact@saeedc.com](mailto:contact@saeedc.com).

My current research interest is building data-driven/differentiable solvers for electrodynamical problems. To that end, I like writing robust, reproducible software. Take a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/saeedece) for some examples of my work.
